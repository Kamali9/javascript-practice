Design like real.
<br />
Material Design is a design language developed by Google to help teams build high-quality digital experiences for Android, iOS, Flutter, and the web.
<br />
 It was based on a grid-based system. 
<br />
The main purpose of Material Design is the creation of a new visual language that combines principles of good design with technical and scientific innovation. Designer <b>Matias Duarte</b> explained that, <b>"unlike real paper</b>, our digital material can expand and reform intelligently. Material has physical surfaces and edges. Seams and shadows provide meaning about what you can touch." Google states that their new design language is based on paper and ink but implementation takes place in an advanced manner.
